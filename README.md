## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

With this tool, you can display, execute and analyze UML state diagrams to get a better understanding of how transitions and regions interact with each other.
Supported analyses:
<br/>

* generate the corresponding reachability graph
* reachability analysis
* maxnode analysis to find a transition sequence covering as many states as possible
* maxtransition analysis to find the longest transition sequence possible

<br/>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<br/>
<strong>[Load UML Diagram]</strong> and navigate to the .svg or .txt file containing your graph <br>
<strong>[Show containment]</strong> to highlight the currently active region in red <br>
<strong>[Hint]</strong> to highlight the currently reachable states <br>
<strong>[Show State Diagram Graph]</strong> to generate the corresponding reachability graph<br>
<strong>[Reachability analysis]</strong> find all reachable states from the initial state <br>
<strong>[Max Node Analysis]</strong> find a transition sequence that contains as many states as possible <br>
<strong>[Max transition Analysis]</strong> to find a transition sequence that contains as many transitions as possible <br>
